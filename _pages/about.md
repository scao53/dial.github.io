Hi, I'm Shiya Cao, an Assistant Professor of Statistical and Data Sciences at Smith College. I created the Disability Inclusion Analytics Lab (DIAL) in Fall 2022, to advance my research in disability inclusion and broader social inclusion topics using quantitative, qualitative, and design science methods. My lab engages Smith College undergraduates in these research topics and helps them pay attention to human, social, and emotional elements of statistics and data science. If you're interested in a research collaboration or joining my lab, please [email me](mailto:scao53@smith.edu).

I've published multiple papers in high-ranking peer-reviewed journals and conferences including *Work: A Journal of Prevention, Assessment & Rehabilitation*, *Behavior & Information Technology*, and *the Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences* as well as a book chapter titled *The Chains that Bind: Gender, Disability, Race, and IT Accommodations*.

My name is Shiya Cao, the founder of the DIAl Lab. I've been working on disability inclusion research since Fall 2016 when I was a graduate student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. I've studied accommodation management systems for disabled employees in the workplace, accessibility issues, applied statistics in disability inclusion using population surveys, the intersection of identity attributes, and the integration of disability inclusion components into statistics and data science pedagogy. I am enthusiastic about the disability inclusion field and am hoping to promote this research and disability awareness in the statsitics and data science community.

Hello, my name is Sarah Susnea. I am a junior majoring in Statistical and Data Sciences and minoring in Sociology. I joined the DIAL lab in Spring 2024. I am excited to apply the quantitative and qualitative analysis skills I’ve learned throughout my studies to research disability inclusion at Smith. I am passionate about data science and statistics’ potential to contribute positively to our society, and I hope to assist the lab with achieving this goal as well as advancing awareness on the topics of disability inclusion.

Hi! I’m Lucia, a junior double majoring in Statistical and Data Sciences and Quantitative Economics. I’m passionate about data analytics and love diving into both qualitative and quantitative research using what I’ve learned in my classes. I’m excited to join the DIAL Lab this fall and can’t wait to learn more about different research methods, practice my data skills, and see how insights can drive real changes, especially in the disability inclusion field.
