Hi, I'm Shiya Cao, an Assistant Professor of Statistical and Data Sciences at Smith College. I created the Disability Inclusion Analytics Lab (DIAL) in Fall 2022, to advance my research in disability inclusion and broader social inclusion topics using quantitative, qualitative, and design science methods. My lab engages Smith College undergraduates in these research topics and helps them pay attention to human, social, and emotional elements of data science.

I've published multiple papers in high-ranking journals and conferences including *Behavior & Information Technology* and *the Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences* as well as a book chapter titled *The Chains that Bind: Gender, Disability, Race, and IT Accommodations*.

I teach courses at Smith College that introduce data science concepts, methods, and techniques and integrate disability inclusion and data ethics into pedagogy.
