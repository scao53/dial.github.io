Hi, I'm Shiya Cao, an Assistant Professor of Statistical and Data Sciences at Smith College. I created the Disability Inclusion Analytics Lab (DIAL) in Fall 2022, to advance my research in disability inclusion and broader social inclusion topics using quantitative, qualitative, and design science methods. My lab engages Smith College undergraduates in these research topics and helps them pay attention to human, social, and emotional elements of data science.

I've published multiple papers in high-ranking journals and conferences including *Behavior & Information Technology* and *the Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences* as well as a book chapter titled *The Chains that Bind: Gender, Disability, Race, and IT Accommodations*.

I teach courses at Smith College that introduce data science concepts, methods, and techniques and integrate disability inclusion and data ethics into pedagogy.

My name is Shiya Cao, the founder of the DIAl Lab. I've been working on disability inclusion research since Fall 2016 when I was a graduate student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. I have studied accommodation management systems for disabled employees in the workplace, digital accessibility, public datasets related to disability inclusion, and the intersection of identity attributes. I am enthusiastic about the disability inclusion field and am hoping to promote this research and disability awareness in the data science and statsitics community.
