## Identity-First Language vs. Person-First Language

We recognize that there is still a debate in the disability community regarding [identity-first versus person-first language](https://jtds.commons.gc.cuny.edu/person-first-language-vs-identity-first-language-an-examination-of-the-gains-and-drawbacks-of-disability-language-in-society/) (Ferrigon & Tucker, 2019). There are valid arguments on both sides. In this lab, we use identity first language, which is more in line with the critical lens and social model we apply, and will continue to learn from research and seek more guidance from self-advocates to inform our work and the language we use. We hope you will receive our work as it is intended, to advocate, support, and empower the disability community.
