## Identity-First Language vs. Person-First Language

We recognize that there is still a debate in the disability community regarding [identity-first versus person-first language](https://jtds.commons.gc.cuny.edu/person-first-language-vs-identity-first-language-an-examination-of-the-gains-and-drawbacks-of-disability-language-in-society/) (Ferrigon & Tucker, 2019). There are valid arguments on both sides. In this lab, we use identity first language, which is more in line with the critical lens and social model we apply, and will continue to learn from research and seek more guidance from self-advocates to inform our work and the language we use. We hope you will receive our work as it is intended, to advocate, support, and empower the disability community.

## Basic Principles of Disability Etiquette

> This section draws from the [Disability Etiquette](https://www.easterseals.com/support-and-education/facts-about-disability/disability-etiquette.html). 

* If you would like to help a disabled person, ask if they need it, and listen to any instructions the person may want to give.
* Be considerate of the extra time it might take a disabled person to get things done or said. Let the person set the pace in walking and talking.
* Treat adults accordingly.
* Call a person by their first name only when you extend this familiarity to everyone present.
* Don’t patronize people who use wheelchairs by patting them on the head.
* Don’t be embarrassed if you happen to use common expressions that seem to relate to the person’s disability such as “See you later” or “I’ve got to run.”
* When planning events involving disabled people, consider their needs ahead of time. If there’s a potential barrier, like a flight of stairs, narrow doors, or an inaccessible restroom, reach out and discuss the situation with them in advance.
* If you have a question about access, always ask it and don’t assume you already know the answer.

### When you're with a wheelchair user:

* **Don’t** lean or hang on someone’s wheelchair.
* **Do** remember that wheelchairs are an extension of personal space.
* Ask permission before touching someone’s wheelchair.
* **Do** place yourself at the wheelchair user’s eye level to spare both of you a stiff neck if you’re talking for more than a few minutes.
* **Do** consider distance, weather conditions and physical obstacles such as stairs, curbs and steep hills when giving directions.

### When you're with people who are blind or have low vision:

* **Don’t** grab a person’s arm in order to guide them.
* **Do** allow the person to take your arm. This will help you to guide, rather than propel or lead, the person.
* **Do** use specifics such as “left a hundred feet” or “right two yards.”

### When you're with people who are deaf or hard-of-hearing:

* **Don’t** shout.
* **Do** look directly at the person and speak clearly and expressively to establish if the person can read your lips. Remember, not everyone who is deaf or hard-of-hearing can lip-read. Those who do will rely on facial expressions and other body language to help understand.
* Show consideration by facing a light source and keeping your hands and food away from your mouth when speaking.
