## About

The Data Ethnography and Advocacy Lab is a multi-disciplinary research group investigating the production, governance, and dissemination of public interest datasets in the United States. In addition to documenting the socio-cultural histories of open government datasets, DEAL is working to innovate new methodologies for studying the social conditions that enable, foster, or incentivize deceptive or distortive data practices. Our work is informed by and contributes to the fields of critical data studies, information studies, and science and technology studies. Further, our work helps to identify opportunities for strengthening US data collection programs, improving data documentation practices, and cultivating deeper data infrastructure literacy.

Outside of research, I am the Head of New Students for Talbot House, I am part of the Pan-Asian in Action e-board, and I am an active member of the Statistical Data Science Coalition of Color.
